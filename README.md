# Played Games Tracker v2.0

This is a webpage for keeping a list of all the PC games that I have finished playing. <br>

## Development CMDs

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page.

# Angular Notes
- Components - Reusable Code Snippets
- Interface - Typescript type declaration

# Played Games Tracker v1.0

The main purpose of this beginner project is to familiarize :

- [x] **Grouping and structuring source directory**
      <br> `Proper dir structure... this is the way`
- [x] **Structuring an HTML more effectively by utilizing JavaScript**
      <br> `JS can be used to render recurring HTML using a loop soo...`
      <br> `Less code = less work? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
      <br> `Probably not.`
- [x] **Connecting a database to webpage**
      <br> `JSON can be read using D3, JQuery, Fetch etc.`
      <br> `Chose JSON because... no API calls, no login nothing.`
      <br> `Perfect fit for my laziness.`
- [x] **Style elements using CSS**
      <br> `Yep, no external libraries.`
      <br> `No bootstrap. Going the long ugly route.`
- [x] **Responsive Web Design**
      <br> `Using flex and media queries.`
- [x] **Implementing Sort by function**
      <br> `Using simple JavaScript.`
