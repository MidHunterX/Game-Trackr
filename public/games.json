    "description": "Mortal Kombat X is the tenth main game in the one-on-one fighting series and a sequel to the 2011 title Mortal Kombat. The game stays close to the visual style and the mechanics of the 2011 reboot. The main controls are still based on two types of punches and kicks, and blocking, to form combos with uppercuts, teleports, special moves that incorporate weapons and fatalities. The three-tiered energy from the previous title returns, making available X-Ray moves, powered up EX moves and combo breakers. As introduced in Injustice: Gods Among Us, characters can use the environment to re-position themselves or optionally use parts as weapons. Each character now has three variations with different moves and weapons. There is once again a sprinting gauge, returning from Mortal Kombat 4.",

The problem is that the protagonists keyhole is his penis and the unlocker is a woman’s hole. This is the basic premise of Euphoria. Combine this with fetish fuel h-scenes (including scat) and some good character writing from time to time. Euphoria differentiates itself completely from the typical game of its genre by exploring more of the taboo aspects of sex rather than the actual sex itself. Because of this, Euphoria feels less like a nukige (despite very much fitting the bill) and more like a visual novel that can stand on its own while also adding to the player’s collection of fetishes.",

Upon the emergence of unidentifiable immortal Witches, the government quarantined the metropolitan area and erased it from the national map, leaving it to ruin. After a while, the ghost town soon became a haven for criminals, illegal immigrants, and people with multiple debts who could not survive in the outside world. In addition, yakuza, black market merchants, and prostitutes also came to the city to take advantage of the situation. The plot begins with a chance encounter between a man and a Witch in this free city of Pandemonium, whose unofficial population has grown to around 150,000.
