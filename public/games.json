Combine this with fetish fuel h-scenes (including scat) and some good character writing from time to time. Euphoria differentiates itself completely from the typical game of its genre by exploring more of the taboo aspects of sex rather than the actual sex itself. Because of this, Euphoria feels less like a nukige (despite very much fitting the bill) and more like a visual novel that can stand on its own while also adding to the player’s collection of fetishes.",
